orknow-一个自由讨论的问答社区

站长是个大学生，常常刷狗乎，但是发现狗乎是越来越恶心，天天删帖小黑屋，不让人说真话，气死人！

每天热榜讨论时事，又不让人说实话，真话，心里话，就留几个大v在搞政治正确，完全违背了一个问答平台获得有价值信息的初衷！

所以就萌生了自己做一个问答社区的想法，毛主席都说，自己动手，丰衣足食！

说干就干，9块钱的域名，130一年的服务器，用开源程序wecenter花一周写了投票和反对数，然后就上线了。

做这个站的目的，是希望各位网友有一个自由讨论的平台，帮助大家快速获得真实，有用，有价值的信息。

目前本站已经开发了投票和反对数功能，大家可以通过这两个功能，初步了解到每一个问题和回答的价值，以及大众对这个问题的看法。

未来，站长忙里偷闲，还将继续开发下列功能http://orknow.com/uploads/article/20210519/d107646bfe33ea55facb41f10414655e.png
。

如果大家有什么意见和建议可以随时发帖或留言，站长绝不删帖。







orknow-a Q&A community for free discussion

The webmaster is a college student who often brushes zhihu, but I find that zhihu is getting more and more disgusting. It deletes posts and ban speaking every day to prevent people from telling the truth and is maddening!

The hot list discusses current affairs every day without letting people tell the truth, the truth, and the truth, leaving a few big v to engage in political correctness, which completely violates the original intention of a Q&A platform to obtain valuable information!

So the idea of doing a question-and-answer community on my own was born. Chairman Mao said, “Do it yourself and have enough food and clothing!”

Do whatever it takes. The domain name is 9 rmb, the server is 130 each year, and the open source program wecenter spent a week writing the vote and opposition numbers, and then it went online.

The purpose of this site is to hope that all netizens will have a free discussion platform to help everyone quickly obtain real, useful and valuable information.

At present, this site has developed voting and opposition functions. Through these two functions, you can get a preliminary understanding of the value of each question and answer, as well as the public's views on this issue.

In the future, webmasters will be busy and will continue to develop the following functions:

answer scoring

question evaluation

Multiple choice voting

mobile application

pay and see content

comment agree and against

sort by length or score

and so on

If you have any comments and suggestions, you can post or leave a message at any time, and the webmaster will never delete the post.
